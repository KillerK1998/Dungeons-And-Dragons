# Overview

I used this program to help me improve my programming  skills and to help improve my problem solving skills.

In this program, I made it so that the user can enter character information for a Dungeons and Dragons like list

I wanted to write this software to help me improve my skills with C++, I've been working on mastering certain aspects of the language and this code shows the knowledge that I've gained while working to improve my skills as a programmer.

# Development Environment
the programming enviornment that I used for this project was in visual studio

As for libraries I used the string library, the vector library, iostream, as well as many other libraries that I used to structure my code.

# Future Work


- add more information to my player class so the user can input more information
- add a couple of functions so the user can input more information.
